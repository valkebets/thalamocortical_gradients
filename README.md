# Thalamocortical gradients


### Motivation

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental diagnosis characterized by social and communication impairment, as well as restrictive and repetitive interests (Hodges et al., 2020). Previous neuroimaging studies have reported both atypical structural and functional brain organization in this condition, but it remains challenging to characterize the substrate of autism. In an effort to characterize cortical function, a recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed atypical functional connectome hierarchy in ASD, reflecting atypical transitions between sensory and higher cognitive networks (Hong et al., 2019). The thalamus is a central subcortical structure, and has been suggested as a hub mediating cortico-cortical integration and sustaining cortical hierarchy (Jones 2001, Shine 2021). How this structure contributes to atypical cortical function in ASD, on the other hand, remains incompletely understood. Here, we profiled thalamo-cortical connectivity in individuals with ASD, capitalizing on novel approaches that simultaneously capture thalamo-cortical connectivity in a compact lower dimensional space.
